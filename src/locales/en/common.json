        "paragraph": "The Saudi Industrial Development Fund was established in 1394 AH (1974 AD) with an initial capital of 500 million riyals to support the industrial development of the Kingdom's economy by providing medium- and long-term loans to new and existing industrial facilities. Subsequent capital increases gradually increased until it reached 105 billion riyals in 1440 AH (2019 AD). Over the course of 50 years, the Industrial Development Fund has provided industrial support tailored to the needs of each stage by enhancing industrial investment opportunities, developing local industry and raising its performance, developing competitive institutions, and supporting strategic initiatives. It has also expanded the scope of its support to include a number of promising sectors in the fields of industry, energy, mining, and logistics services, thus becoming the primary financial enabler for industrial transformation and contributing to the growth and development of the national economy.",
